## Overview

As AI transforms the labor market, this dashboard provides real-time tracking of U.S. job openings across multiple sectors, along with national unemployment rate data. See which industries are growing, which are shrinking, and how the job landscape is evolving. Data is automatically fetched from the BLS public API and stored using Convex for instant reactive updates.

### Features

- **Real-time Data**: Automatic monthly updates via Convex cron jobs
- **Multi-Sector Analysis**: Compare job openings across manufacturing, healthcare, retail, tech, and more
- **Interactive Charts**: Time range filtering (1Y, 3Y, 5Y, 10Y, ALL) with trendline visualization
- **Dual Views**: Toggle between job openings and unemployment rate perspectives
- **Auto-Generated Insights**: Dynamic analysis including peak comparisons and sector trends
- **Loading Skeletons**: Professional loading states with animated placeholders
- **Responsive Design**: Modern dark theme optimized for all screen sizes
- **Accessible**: WCAG-compliant with ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support
- **Error Resilient**: Error boundaries prevent crashes and provide graceful fallbacks

## Data Sources

All data is sourced from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics:

| Series ID | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `JTS000000000000000JOL` | Total Nonfarm Job Openings |
| `JTS300000000000000JOL` | Manufacturing |
| `JTS620000000000000JOL` | Healthcare |
| `JTS440000000000000JOL` | Retail Trade |
| `JTS540000000000000JOL` | Professional & Business Services |
| `JTS510000000000000JOL` | Information |
| `JTS900000000000000JOL` | Government |
| `LNS14000000` | National Unemployment Rate |

Data is released monthly by BLS:
- **JOLTS**: First Tuesday of each month (~2 month lag)
- **Employment Situation**: First Friday of each month

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start development server |
| `npm run build` | Build for production |
| `npm run start` | Start production server |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |
| `npm run test` | Run tests in watch mode |
| `npm run test:run` | Run tests once |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Run tests with coverage report |
| `npx convex dev` | Start Convex development |

## Testing

This project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) with [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) for testing.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test

# Run tests once
npm run test:run

# Run with coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Test Coverage

| Category | Tests | Files |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Utility Functions | 54 | `bls.test.ts`, `chart-utils.test.ts`, `useChartData.test.ts` |
| Components | 34 | `AnimatedCounter.test.tsx`, `SectorFilter.test.tsx`, `ChartControls.test.tsx` |
| Integration | 14 | `page.test.tsx` |
| **Total** | **102** | **7 test files** |

### Writing Tests

Tests follow Testing Library best practices:
- Query by accessible roles and labels
- Test user interactions, not implementation details
- Use `userEvent` for realistic user interactions

## Accessibility

This dashboard follows WCAG 2.1 guidelines:

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support with visible focus indicators
- **Screen Reader Support**: ARIA labels and live regions for dynamic content
- **Skip Navigation**: Skip link to bypass header and jump to main content
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy and landmark regions
- **Color Contrast**: Meets WCAG AA standards for text contrast
- **Button States**: Proper `aria-pressed` for toggle buttons

## Configuration

### Convex Cron Schedule

The data fetch is scheduled for the 7th of each month at 2:00 PM UTC to ensure both JOLTS and unemployment data are available:

```typescript
// convex/crons.ts
crons.monthly(
  "fetch-bls-data",
  { day: 7, hourUTC: 14, minuteUTC: 0 },
  internal.blsFetch.fetchLatestData
);
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` | Yes | Your Convex deployment URL |

## Architecture Highlights

### Shared Abstractions

The codebase follows DRY principles with shared infrastructure:

- **`useChartData.ts`**: Custom hooks for chart data processing
  - `useSimpleChartData` - Single-value series (unemployment)
  - `useMultiSeriesChartData` - Multi-sector series (job openings)
  
- **`ChartControls.tsx`**: Shared time range and trendline controls

- **`ChartTooltip.tsx`**: Configurable tooltip with pre-built variants

### Loading States

Professional skeleton components provide smooth loading experiences:
- `ChartSkeleton` - Animated chart placeholder
- `StatsSkeleton` - Stats section placeholder
